**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!**

Navigate and manage your MEGA cloud storage directly from the comfort of your
terminal! MegaTUI provides an intuitive text-based user interface (TUI)
powered by the excellent [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual)
framework.

It interacts with your MEGA account by leveraging the official
[MEGAcmd](https://github.com/meganz/MEGAcmd) command-line tools in the
background.

The UI and bindings are inspired by [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) and
[lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf).

## ü™∑ Features

As of writing this (_2025-07-01_), work is still ongoing and active.

- **Browse Files:** Navigate through your MEGA cloud drive folders.
- **Basic Navigation:** Use intuitive keybindings (like `j`/`k`, `h`/`l`, `Enter`/`Backspace`) to move up, down, into, and out of directories.
- **Directory Listing:** View files and directories within the current path.
- **Status Bar:** See information about the currently selected item.
- **Refresh:** Update the current directory view.
- **Rename file/directories:** Rename files via the app.
- **Create new directories**
- **Login Check:** Verifies your MEGAcmd login status on startup.

## ‚úèÔ∏è (Planned / TODO)

- [x] Implement file operations (Get, Put, Rename, Delete, Copy, Move) based on supported `mega-*` commands.
- [ ] Search functionality.
- [ ] Multi-pane views.
- [ ] Caching to improve performance.
- [ ] File Previews (basic info, potentially text content).
- [ ] Display detailed directory/account usage (total storage usage, account details, etc).
- [ ] Robust error handling.
- [ ] Configuration options.
- [ ] Background transfer monitoring.
- [ ] Logging in (with 2FA support), and logging out.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation (Development Only)

**These instructions are for development purposes only. The package is not even in alpha!**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **Python:** Version 3.13 is what is currently being used (subject to change potentially).
2.  **MEGAcmd:** The official MEGA command-line tool.

    - Download and install it from the [official MEGAcmd GitHub releases page](https://github.com/meganz/MEGAcmd/releases).
    - **Crucially:** You need to **log in** to your MEGA account using MEGAcmd
      _before_ running MegaTUI.
      - Open your terminal and run `mega-login your-email@example.com` and follow the prompts.
        You can verify your login status with `mega-whoami`.
      - MegaTUI currently relies on an existing MEGAcmd session.
    - Run `mega-cmd-server` as a daemon process in the background (speed of
      command execution will be severely reduced otherwise).

3.  **(Recommended)** Install `uv` for package and virtual environment management.
4.  `git clone https://github.com/yaaama/megatui.git && cd megatui`
5.  `uv sync`
6.  To run the project: `uv run /path/to/main.py`
